<h3 align="center">Hello! 🖐</h3>

I'm Daniel, a professional with 4 years of specialization in Python, SQL, Statistics and Big Data. Experienced in Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques, from exploratory analysis to deployment via RestAPI. 👀

I have great ease in conversations about problems/resolutions, as well as a graphic and data storytelling skills, making use of libraries such as SKLearn, Numpy, Matplotlib, Pytorch, Pandas, Tensorflow, among others. 🧠

I enjoy image/film/audio media and the use of computer vision to perform tasks, using OpenCV for tracking, classification, and autoencoders, among others. 🎶

Recently, I've been working on creating NLP models using LLMs for chatbots. ✔
